# Hundred Days Of Swift

## Introduction

Through this repository I aim to document my journey of learn iOS App development in 100 days. In a 100 days [October 19 2024], I aim to be able to build an iOS App independently.

I am using the following [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) from Udemy to learn the foundations

## Journey

### Day 1 (13th July 2024)

Built a basic app that displays some text and a image using Storyboard. The aim was to get familiar with building the app on the simulator and a physical device.

### Day 2 (14th July 2024)

Today I implemented a PR title validation pipeline that verifies using a swift script if the PR title conforms to the pattern `Day 1 | Description`

In addition, we also completed the I am poor challenge of the course and also complete the random dice number generator.

While completing the dice number generator app, I learn how to attach function to ui elements, how to refer ui elements in code. We use the `Int.random` function to generate a random integer then I used a switch case to convert that to a word so we could update the image ref
